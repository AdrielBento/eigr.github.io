<p class="lead mt-5">eigr.io â€“ A Serverless Runtime on the BEAM</p>
{{< /blocks/cover >}}

{{% blocks/lead %}}
Serverless runtimes are often hidden in a cloud providers offering and exposed solely by their programming API and deployment procedures. In this talk, we'll explore an open-source Serverless runtime built for the cloud and on-premises, running on the BEAM with a polyglot programming model to build general purpose applications.

    Building general purpose applications using multiple languages and having a story how to handle state was our main
    motivation to explore the space of a Serverless runtime to be built. An open source project, currently hibernating,
    based on Akka with a promising technical concept let us to build that runtime. We think the BEAM, OTP and
    Elixir/Erlang are a perfect match for that to build on it.
