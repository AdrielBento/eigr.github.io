We're excited to be selected
for [one of the main talks](https://codesync.global/speaker/marcel-lanz/#947a-serverless-runtime-on-the-beam) at the
CodeBEAM Europe conference in Stockholm in May
2022 [CodeBEAM Europe](https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2022/).

## Abstract

Serverless runtimes are often hidden in cloud providers offering and exposed solely by their programming API and
deployment procedures. In this talk, we'll explore an open-source Serverless runtime built for the cloud and
on-premises, running on the BEAM with a polyglot programming model to build general-purpose applications.

In this talk, we'll present how the BEAM and OTP are an ideal fit to build a Serverless runtime. After an introduction
about Serverless and a polyglot programming model, we'll present the open-source project at eigr.io where we implemented
the core of our runtime based on Erlang/OTP and written in Elixir.
