Recently a [article](https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90)
launched by the Amazon Prime team reactivated the Monoliths versus Microservices discussion. It is remarkable, and often reproachable, 
how many fervent feelings there are around this already old discussion.
I've always wondered what the point really was between these two often conflicting views of the world. And I could never understand why 
so much energy is spent in this type of discussion.

In this article I intend to introduce you to why it's time to move forward and how our Spawn technology can help developers 
let go of these age-old issues, and that do not add much value to the business.

## Conclusion

This whole discussion around Microservices vs Monoliths is a lot of fun and a excellent mental exercise, but we as software engineers must remember
that at the end of the day, it is our deliveries of value to the business that will make the difference. Spawn with its polyglot serverless experience, 
using the full potential of Cloud's open standards can help you take big steps in that direction. 
Without you having to waste precious hours around such warm discussions and far from the big goal. Solve your business problems!
