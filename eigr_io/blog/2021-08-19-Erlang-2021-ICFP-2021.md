We're excited to be selected
for [one of the Lightning Talks](https://icfp21.sigplan.org/details/erlang-2021-papers/13/Lightning-Talk-eigr-io-A-Serverless-Runtime-on-the-BEAM)
right after the Erlang Keynote at the ACM SIGPLAN, [ICFP Erlang Workshop 2021](https://icfp21.sigplan.org/home/erlang-2021).

## Abstract

Serverless runtimes are often hidden in a cloud providers offering and exposed
solely by their programming API and deployment procedures. In this talk, weâ€™ll
explore an open-source Serverless runtime built for the cloud and on-premises,
running on the BEAM with a polyglot programming model to build general purpose
applications.

Building general purpose applications using multiple languages and having a
story how to handle state was our main motivation to explore the space of a
Serverless runtime to be built. We think the BEAM, OTP and Elixir/Erlang are a
perfect match to build on.

With this talk, we combine herein the world of the BEAM with cloud technology
like a gRPC-based protocol, Kubernetes and a polyglot programming model with
languages supported like Go, JavaScript, JVM-languages, Python and many more.
